Thoughts on protocol support for beanstalkd

Good things:
- Reserve semantics are very clear
- I like beanstalkd, so having interop with it would be very nice

Less good things:
- Unclear how topics would work on the client side
  - All protocol traffic appears to be client generated
  - Server doesn't originate traffic back to clients
- Big list of commands to implement
- Some operations would be hard to support
   - priority
   - delay
   - bury/kick

- see protocol doc: https://github.com/kr/beanstalkd/raw/master/doc/protocol.txt
- supported operations:
  - put (priority and delay ignored)
  - reserve
  - reserve-with-timeout
  - delete
  - release (priority and delay ignored)
  - use
  - watch
  - ignore
  - touch
  - list-tubes
  - list-tube-used
  - list-tubes-watched
  - stats-tube (partial)  will return these fields per tube:
     - name
     - current-jobs-ready
     - current-jobs-reserved
     - total-jobs (since radiator was started. not persistent)
     - current-waiting
  - stats (partial)
- unsupported operations:
  - bury
  - kick
  - peek <id>
  - peek-delayed
  - peek-buried
  - stats-job
  - pause-tube
