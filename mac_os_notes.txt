Notes to get gevent working on Mac OS (Snow Leopard)

- Install macports
- Install libevent
     $ sudo port install libevent

   This installs into:  /opt/local
   I'm assuming that's what it did on your system.  
   If not, change the paths below accordingly.

- In your virtualenv
     $ source bin/activate
     $ pip install cython
     $ pip install gevent

This will fail (or it did for me..), but you'll have the sources in build/gevent

- Build/install gevent manually 
     $ cd build/gevent
     $ python setup.py build -I/opt/local/include -L/opt/local/lib
     $ python setup.py install

Done!

Today I learned you can fix this another way. gcc will look for some environment 
variables by default.  This is way easier.

export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/local/include
export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib

pip install gevent
